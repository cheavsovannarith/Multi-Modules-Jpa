include::{snippets}/home/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/home/http-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/home/http-response.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/home/httpie-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/home/request-body.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/home/response-body.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/home/response-fields.adoc[]
